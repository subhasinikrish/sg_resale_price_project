# sg_resale_price_project

Objectives:
    The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it     aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

STEPS FOLLOWED
  Downloaded the data set and detected outliers in the dataset
  
  Transformed the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps
  
  Created ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Resale flat_Price’
  
  Here I used Decision Tree Regression model
  
  Created a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Resale_Price predicted value

TECHNOLOGIES USED
  Python scripting,Pandas,Numpy,Seaborn,Matplotlib,Data Preprocessing,EDA, Streamlit,pickle
